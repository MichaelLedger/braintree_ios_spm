# MCP Server Setup Guide

The [mcp-server.js](mdc:mcp-server.js) provides a webhook endpoint that automatically updates this package when new Braintree iOS SDK versions are released.

## Configuration

Before deploying, configure these environment variables:

- `PORT` - The port for the server to listen on (default: 3000)
- `GITHUB_SECRET` - The webhook secret for GitHub signature verification
- `BRAINTREE_REPO` - The repository to listen for events from (default: 'braintree/braintree_ios')

## Local Testing

To run the server locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the server
node mcp-server.js
```

## Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Action workflow for deployment:

- [deploy-mcp-server.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/deploy-mcp-server.yml)

This workflow deploys the MCP server to Heroku by default, but can be modified for other platforms.

### Required Secrets

Set these GitHub repository secrets:

- `HEROKU_API_KEY`
- `HEROKU_APP_NAME`
- `HEROKU_EMAIL`
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Setting Up the Webhook

After deploying the MCP server:

1. Go to the official Braintree iOS repository on GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
3. Set the Payload URL to your MCP server endpoint (e.g., `https://your-app.herokuapp.com/webhook`)
4. Set the Content type to `application/json`
5. Set the Secret to the same value as your `GITHUB_SECRET` environment variable
6. Select "Just the release event" under "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?"
7. Ensure "Active" is checked
8. Click "Add webhook"
