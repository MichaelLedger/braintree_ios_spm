# Braintree iOS SPM Project Overview

This repository is a Swift Package Manager (SPM) wrapper for the Braintree iOS SDK. It automatically downloads the official Braintree iOS SDK XCFramework from the [braintree/braintree_ios](mdc:https:/github.com/braintree/braintree_ios) repository and creates an SPM-compatible package.

## Key Components

- [Package.swift](mdc:Package.swift) - The Swift Package Manager manifest file that defines the binary target with URL and checksum
- [package.json](mdc:package.json) - Contains metadata about the package and the Braintree SDK version being used
- [update-framework.sh](mdc:update-framework.sh) - Script to manually update the Braintree SDK version
- [.github/workflows/update-xcframework.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/update-xcframework.yml) - GitHub Action that updates the package when a new release is published

## Current Version

The repository is currently set up to use Braintree iOS SDK version 6.30.0.
