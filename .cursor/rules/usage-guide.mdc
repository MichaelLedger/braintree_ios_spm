# Usage Guide

This repository provides a Swift Package Manager (SPM) compatible distribution of the Braintree iOS SDK. Here's how to use it in your iOS projects:

## Adding the Package Dependency

### In Xcode

1. In Xcode, select File → Swift Packages → Add Package Dependency
2. Enter the repository URL
3. Select the version you want to use (recommended: Use the "Up to Next Major" versioning rule)

### In Package.swift

Add the dependency to your Package.swift file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/braintree_ios_spm.git", from: "6.30.0")
]
```

Then add the dependency to your target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "BraintreeSDK", package: "braintree_ios_spm")
        ]
    )
]
```

## Importing in Your Code

```swift
import BraintreeSDK
```

## Documentation

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [official Braintree documentation](mdc:https:/developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/start/hello-client/ios/v5).

## Verifying the Package

The [Package.swift](mdc:Package.swift) file includes a SHA-256 checksum to verify the integrity of the downloaded XCFramework. This ensures you're using the exact binary published by Braintree.
