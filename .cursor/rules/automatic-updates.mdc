# Automatic Update Workflow

This project uses two mechanisms to stay in sync with the official Braintree iOS SDK:

## 1. GitHub Actions Workflow

The [update-xcframework.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/update-xcframework.yml) workflow automatically runs when:
- A new release is published in this repository
- The workflow is manually triggered

The workflow:
1. Downloads the Braintree XCFramework from the official repository
2. Calculates the SHA-256 checksum 
3. Updates [Package.swift](mdc:Package.swift) and [package.json](mdc:package.json) with the URL and checksum
4. Commits and pushes the changes

## 2. MCP Server

The [mcp-server.js](mdc:mcp-server.js) provides a webhook endpoint that listens for release events from the official Braintree iOS repository.

When a new Braintree SDK version is released:
1. GitHub sends a webhook event to the MCP server
2. The server verifies the webhook signature
3. The server executes [update-framework.sh](mdc:update-framework.sh) with the new version
4. The changes are committed and pushed automatically

## URL Format

The Braintree iOS SDK XCFramework is downloaded using this URL format:
```
https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/releases/download/{VERSION}/Braintree.xcframework.zip
```

For example, version 6.30.0 is at:
```
https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/releases/download/6.30.0/Braintree.xcframework.zip
```
